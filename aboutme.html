			<h>Hello, hello!</h>
			<p>I'm Samantha Lee and I am currently attending UC Berkeley. I'm studying Cognitive Science and Business Administration. During my time here, I have been able to discover an interest for product design, product marketing, and product management. 
			<br>
			<br>
			So, how did I develop this passion for business and design?
			<br>
			<br>
			Growing up, I was always surrounded by artists. Thus, art has always been a huge part of my life. In fact, the earliest gifts that I can remember consisted of color pencils and paintbrushes (thank you, Santa). 
			<br>
			<br>
			From a young age, I was really able to develop my interests in design and business when my mother opened her spa on the side of the freeway. I designed brochures, created the business cards, and asked neighboring stores to put our advertisements on display. As the spa attracted more customers, I understood the connection between business and design. I saw the huge impact of seemingly negligible artistic elements such as font size, boldness, color scheme, etc. Little did I know that experience would lead to my interests in marketing and product design.
			<br>
			<br>
			Currently a sophomore at Cal, I have expanded my interest in human-centered design design to product marketing, product design and product management. My passion for this area leaves me enthusiastic and excited for the future projects to come!
